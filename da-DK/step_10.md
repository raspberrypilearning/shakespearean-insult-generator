## What next

- Could you change the colour or size of the text on the GUI? Check out the [documentation](https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/text/) to help you.
- Could you change the GUI so that it contains three drop-down boxes, each containing one of the lists of words? Users can pick their own insult using the three drop-down boxes.
- Could you allow users to rate the insults, and save the full insult plus its rating into a separate CSV file?
- Could you read this CSV file and calculate the highest-rated insult?
